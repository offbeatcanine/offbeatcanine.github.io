                My journey into the world of dog training began over a decade ago when I embarked on my first job as a dog walker. It was during this time that I encountered a diverse array of canine companions, each with their own unique personalities and behaviors. From lively Vizslas to steadfast Dobermans, I found myself captivated by the intricacies of canine behavior and the deep bond between dogs and their humans.

                My passion for understanding and connecting with dogs led me to explore various avenues within the canine industry, from daycare facilities to rescue organizations. I've been lucky to work with and learn from some great people, further fueling my desire to pursue a career in dog training.

                Driven by a passion for continuous learning and growth, I pursued formal education at CATCH Canine Academy, where I honed my skills through a comprehensive curriculum. Combining my hands-on experience with theoretical knowledge, I've developed a holistic approach to dog training that prioritizes education and understanding.

                At Offbeat Canine Training, my mission is to revolutionize dog training by focusing on education. Just as humans invest in endless skill classes, I believe that dogs deserve the same level of education to thrive in their environments. I specialize in bridging the communication gap between dogs and their handlers, empowering humans to speak the language of their canine companions.
