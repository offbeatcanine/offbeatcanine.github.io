                    Following a <strong>free</strong> phone consultation, we'll schedule
                    a visit to your home to observe your dog's behavior in their
                    natural environment. During this session, we'll conduct a thorough
                    behavioral evaluation and provide you with detailed insight on
                    the behavior patterns. This visit gives the trainer the chance
                    to understand and observe the moments in your routine that obedience
                    could benefit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following this visit your trainer will formulate a
                    customized training plan for you and your canine's genre of
                    life. Our goal is to establish a strong foundation built on
                    trust and communication, tailored to your dog's unique needs
                    and your realistic expectations. If all goes well, you'll
