1000000/10 would recommend! Megan has been nothing but knowledgeable, passionate, and welcoming since we began training with our new pup. After a couple months of private in home training sessions, our boy has found some newfound confidence and has so many new skills! We will continue to reach out to Megan for sessions as our boy grows up, and I recommend those looking for a trainer to reach out to Offbeat Canine if you are looking for a trainer who is welcoming, listens, and teams up with you on training up your pup.
