We contacted Meg when we adopted a lab/shepherd mix. We are more experienced with small breeds and were feeling extremely overwhelmed by our new big puppy. It was very apparent after our audition that we made the right choice. Meg is very knowledgeable and truly wants to meet owners and their dogs where they are at. She tailors training to work for you and your respective lifestyle. Most importantly, she does everything with great compassion and without judgement. Each jam session made a HUGE difference in our lives. We now have a much more manageable, loving puppy who is fitting into our family wonderfully. We will definitely be back for more continued education jam sessions as our puppy ages. Thank you for everything Meg!
