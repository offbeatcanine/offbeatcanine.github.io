We cannot say enough good things about Meg! From the very beginning, when we brought our dog Frankie home this summer, she has been an invaluable resource. She guided us through crate training, leash training, and so much more, making what could have been a stressful process so much smoother.  
  
In addition to walking and training Frankie once a week, she recently took him in for a board and train program, and the results have been incredible. His skills have improved so quickly, and he is now such a well-behaved and confident dog. Her dedication, expertise, and genuine care for our pup are unmatched.  
  
I can always send her a quick text when I have a question or need help with Frankie and she always sends over a detailed response to help guide me in that moment. I cannot imagine managing a new puppy without her.  
  
If youâ€™re looking for someone who is not only knowledgeable but also truly passionate about helping dogs and their owners succeed, look no further. We are so grateful for everything she has done for us and Frankie! ðŸ˜Š
