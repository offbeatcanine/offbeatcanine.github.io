I went to Meg because I was concerned about my dog, Lily, after two separate dog attacks by off leash dogs. She had become skittish and what people might consider "reactive" on our walks. Meg was approachable, non judgmental, kind and most of all, knowledgeable. She taught me how to watch Lily and her body language. She gave feedback every step of the way! She didn't just focus on that, either. She gave me invaluable advice on my handling. We are now back out enjoying our walks, playing new games, and just plain having fun!
