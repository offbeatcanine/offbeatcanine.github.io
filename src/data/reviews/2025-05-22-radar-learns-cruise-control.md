Meg at Offbeat Canine has been absolutely amazing helping us train our Corgi, Radar.  We started off with 6 sessions when he was about 7 months old, Then he did a 10 day board and train while we were on vacation. During the initial sessions she came to our house and worked with us on having a "place" for Radar so he wouldn't be just wandering around getting into mischief. We also worked on leash etiquette on walks. Meg is super knowledgeable about how dogs learn and has a very effective way of teaching you how to interact with your dog to get the results that you want. During the 10 day board and train session, I felt very comfortable knowing my dog was safe and being properly cared for. Meg sent me pictures, videos and messages every day outlining the training she worked on with him each day. When we returned, she made sure we knew how to follow thru on everything he learned. It was amazing! He learned SO much!! Meg cares about each of her clients as if they were her own dog. She is truly passionate about what she does, and she is very good at it! I highly recommend Offbeat Canine.
