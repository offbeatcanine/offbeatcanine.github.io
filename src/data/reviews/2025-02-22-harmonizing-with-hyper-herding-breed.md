If you’re looking for a friendly, flexible and caring trainer you should definitely check out Offbeat. Our Australian shepherd has been part of the band for months now and our girl has grown more confident and content in our home and around others.  
  
Our pup looks forward to seeing Megan come through our door and is immediately exciting to start learning, as are we. She has helped us in so many situations of learning all the ways of loving and caring for a herding breed even when all felt lost after our girls reactivity started. Our pup was attacked a few months before finding Offbeat and Meg has always been so supportive and caring for our girl and her needs and ours and how to help with both our anxiety’s around other pups while building confidence.  
  
We also boarded with Offbeat which was so easy and comforting knowing she was being well cared for and we loved the updates of seeing her happy as ever!!  
  
Thank you Megan for all of your hard work with training us and our crazy kids to best help our furry friend! Thank you for always being flexible and a positive presence in our home for us all! We cannot wait to see what more we will learn from you in the future!
