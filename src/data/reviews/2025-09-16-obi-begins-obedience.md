Megan has been incredible to work with! We recently completed the 6-week program, and she guided me every step of the way to give Obi exactly what he needed. She worked through real-life scenarios with us and showed me how to handle unexpected situations with confidence. Her support has helped me get Obi to where he is today, and I finally feel prepared for whatever comes our way. I highly recommend Megan and will definitely continue going back for more training!
