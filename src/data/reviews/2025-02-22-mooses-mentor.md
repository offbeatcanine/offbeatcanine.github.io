Megan is a knowledgeable, judgement free trainer that will meet you where you are at in your journey handling your pup to come up with an individualized plan to set you and your family up for success! Moose and I have loved working with her to learn new techniques as well as coping mechanisms to get through adolescent puppy hurdles. I couldnâ€™t recommend Megan more. The biggest plus is she will come to you! She is extremely flexible and patient as well!
