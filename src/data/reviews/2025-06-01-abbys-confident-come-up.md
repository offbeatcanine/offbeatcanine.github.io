We have been working with Megan at Offbeat Canine for a few months now and the progress we have made with our dog Abby is amazing. When we met Megan we had a super easily excited puppy who didn’t have the best manners around other dogs and loved pulling on leash. Megan provided us with the proper tools and training to help us be confident when handling Abby which in turn meant Abby felt much more confident in herself in the world. I would highly recommend Offbeat Canine to anyone looking for a personalized training experience (mostly for the humans). Thank you Megan!!!
