Megan has been so wonderful with my young golden retriever, Goose. She truly knows how to break things down for someone who doesn't know what they're doing. Her patience has really helped me not get frustrated in sessions when neither of us are understanding and it's gone a long way in his training. Her flexibility has been so helpful and I can truly not recommend Megan enough!
