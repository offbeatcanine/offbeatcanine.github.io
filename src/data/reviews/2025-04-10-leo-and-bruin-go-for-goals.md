Meg has been amazing with my boys Leo & Bruin - they are two crazy little corgis. I truly had no idea what I was doing, but Meg listened to my concerns and goals from the very beginning to make sure we tailored a plan that worked best for us. We just finished up our 6-session package - but we plan to continue to work with Meg to keep their skills sharp and continue to learn from her!!
