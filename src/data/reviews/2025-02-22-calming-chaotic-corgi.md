We reached out to Megan from Offbeat Canine after realizing our Corgi pup, Finn, was struggling with barrier aggression and showing some challenging behaviors, like lunging at moving cars during walks. We discovered her services through a local Corgi Facebook group, and from the moment we reached out, she has been incredibly communicative and supportive.  
  
From day one, Megan has gone above and beyond to help us. She is not only extremely knowledgeable but also incredibly patient - not just with Finn but with us as well! She comes to our home, which has been incredibly convenient, and it’s clear that she is truly passionate about what she does.  
  
Her training has completely transformed our walks and Finn’s behavior. Before, we couldn’t walk Finn without him chasing cars or barking and lunging at people and dogs. Now, he heels beautifully, sits and waits on command, and no longer reacts. She’s also helped us desensitize him to vacuums and address his barrier aggression.  
  
We’ve done two board-and-train sessions with her, and each time, we knew Finn was in the best possible care. She sent us daily updates with photos and videos, which helped us feel connected and at ease while he was away. We missed him, but we never had to worry about him for a second.  
  
What we love most is that Megan is not just training Finn - she's teaching us how to be better dog owners. She gives us resources, tools, and advice that have made such a difference.  
  
If you’re looking for someone who is not only a skilled trainer but also genuinely cares about your dog and your family, we couldn’t recommend Offbeat Canine enough. She has made such a positive impact on our lives, and we’re so grateful to have found her!
