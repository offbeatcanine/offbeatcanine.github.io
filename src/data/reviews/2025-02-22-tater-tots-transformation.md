I contacted Meg after my vet recommended her to help train our new corgi puppy, Tate aka Tater Tot. My puppy was showing signs of resource guarding, and I really wanted to modify this behavior while he was still young. She came to my home and trained Tate and ME on how to help modify this behavior, along with supplementing his basic obedience training.  
  
After one session with her, Tate showed significant improvement with his resource guarding! I was truly amazed. My family and I continued to work with Meg, when we decided to try a Board and Train.  
  
She did such a phenomenal job! It was so obvious she cared for him just as much as we did. We discussed expectations, but she far exceeded them. She even got Tate to go downstairs - which he had been terrified of after a tumble! Tate came back truly a different dog. She even provided us with "A Guide to Tater" to help us use all the same terminology she used when working with him.  
  
Meg went above and beyond, and I highly recommend her!
